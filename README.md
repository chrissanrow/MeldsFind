## Why

I created this tool as a newer Mahjong player wanting to explore algorithmic ways to approach Mahjong as well as utilize CV to make the experience more seamless and interesting.
It's not meant to be a necessarily discrete tool to allow you to cheat, but more of an experimental tool that you might use to see how your decisions align with something more computational.
