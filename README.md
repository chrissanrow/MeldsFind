## Why

I created this tool as a newer Mahjong player wanting to explore algorithmic ways to approach Mahjong as well as utilize CV to make the experience more seamless and interesting.
It's not meant to be some kind of discrete tool to allow you to cheat, but more of an experimental tool that you might use to see how your real decisions align with something more computational.

### Features

- Tile detection

## Install
